Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed on your system.

Create and activate a virtual environment for the project.

Install the project dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

Run the main script to execute the full pipeline.

The script will automatically:

pull real-time stock prices

build an intraday correlation heatmap

fetch live option chains for each ticker

simulate Monte Carlo price paths

compute terminal price distributions

price calls and puts for multiple strikes

detect mispricing vs market

display visual plots

export results to mc_options_pricing_multi_ticker_realtime.csv

The generated CSV can be opened directly in Excel for further analysis.

The heatmap image is saved as correlation_heatmap_intraday.png.
